## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## GamePlayRules
There are eight different pairs of cards on the grid, thus making a total of sixteen cards.
The goal is to match all eight pairs in as few moves as possible. The moves are tracked and as the number of
moves increases the star rating drops.
The star rating is as follows:
Less than or equal to fifteen (15) moves results in a three (3) star win
Between sixteen (16) and twenty (20) moves results in a two (2) star win
Over twenty (20) moves results in a one (1) star win

## FuturePlans
Increase the number of stars and adjust the rules of the game allowing the star rating to drop over time as well as when the number of moves increases.

Add different icon sets and let the user choose between a few card themes.

Add a cheat button, that can be activated only once before any moves are made, that will flash all cards for one (1) second before the game starts. The cheat button will cost a pre-determined number of moves.

Improve game statistics storage. Add player names and a leader board. The current version only tracks the previous play and resets every time the game is reopened.
